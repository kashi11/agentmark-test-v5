# Setup & integration

Triggered when a user says "set up AgentMark in this project," "wire AgentMark into my app," "integrate AgentMark with my existing code," or after they hit the handoff line printed by `npm create agentmark`. This workflow takes the user from "MCP config + `agentmark.json` on disk" to "a working prompt loads in the SDK and a trace shows up in `agentmark dev`."

If the user wants to *provision a Cloud app and connect git* without touching local code yet, use [headless-with-mcp.md](headless-with-mcp.md) instead.

## Single source of truth: the docs MCP

This file describes the **shape** of the conversation and the **order** of operations — nothing else. Framework-specific paths, package names, CLI flags, `agentmarkPath` conventions, and every other piece of integration content live in **one place**: `https://docs.agentmark.co`, queryable via the docs MCP server (`https://docs.agentmark.co/mcp`) or by appending `.md` to any docs URL and using `WebFetch`.

**Never encode integration content into this workflow.** When you need to know where a Next.js project's client file goes, what package to install for Pydantic AI, or what flag `agentmark run-prompt` takes — query the docs MCP, or run `npx agentmark <cmd> --help`. If two sources disagree, the docs win. This is the same rule SKILL.md establishes in [How to find current information](../SKILL.md#how-to-find-current-information); a setup workflow is no exception.

If the docs MCP isn't responding, or doesn't cover the user's framework, **stop and tell the user**. Do not invent paths or package names from memory. The right escalation is "the docs don't cover this framework — want me to set it up using the closest covered pattern (X), or hold while we add docs for your stack?"

## Before you start

Confirm the CLI handoff actually happened — if any are missing, the user skipped `npm create agentmark`:

- [ ] `agentmark.json` exists at the project root
- [ ] `agentmark/` directory exists (the CLI creates it empty, with a `.gitkeep`); `agentmarkPath` in `agentmark.json` resolves the prompt-root to `<agentmarkPath>/agentmark`
- [ ] At least one MCP config file exists (`.mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, or `.zed/settings.json`) and lists **both** the `agentmark` (Cloud) server and the `agentmark-docs` (docs MCP) server
- [ ] Cloud auth resolves — `~/.agentmark/auth.json` exists OR `AGENTMARK_API_KEY` is set
- [ ] Your MCP client lists tools from `agentmark` AND from `agentmark-docs`. Both are required — `agentmark` for Cloud ops, `agentmark-docs` for the integration content this workflow defers to.

If any are missing, tell the user to run `npm create agentmark` first. Do not recreate those files from this workflow — that is the CLI's job, and duplicating it here is how the two paths drift apart.

## Step 1 — Detect the project (filesystem only)

Read the codebase with `Read` / `Glob` / `Grep`. The detection task is local; **do not call MCP tools here**. Identify:

- Language (TypeScript / Python / other) — from `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`
- Framework name and major version (Next.js, Hono, FastAPI, Mastra, etc.)
- Existing LLM-SDK call sites (`streamText`, `generateObject`, `client.messages.create`, `openai.ChatCompletion`, …) — record locations; needed for Step 8
- Monorepo? Workspace boundaries? Identify the host workspace before deciding where AgentMark sits.

Then move to Step 2 — do not propose a placement from your detection alone.

## Step 2 — Fetch the integration page from the docs MCP

Query the docs MCP server for the integration guide. Try in this order:

1. `<framework> integration` (e.g. "Next.js integration")
2. `<framework> quickstart`
3. `<adapter> setup` (e.g. "ai-sdk setup", "pydantic-ai setup")

Read the page in full. **The page is the authority on**:

- Which `@agentmark-ai/*` (or `agentmark-py`) package to install
- Where the prompts directory goes
- Where the client file goes
- What `agentmarkPath` should be set to
- Any framework-specific gotchas

If no page matches, stop and tell the user. Do not extrapolate from a different framework's page without explicit consent.

## Step 3 — Propose, don't act

Summarize the docs-page guidance back to the user as a concrete plan, **citing the docs page you read**. Example shape:

> Based on the Next.js integration guide (docs.agentmark.co/integrations/nextjs), here's the plan:
>
> 1. Install `<package-from-docs>`
> 2. Place prompts at `<path-from-docs>`
> 3. Add the client file at `<path-from-docs>`
> 4. Scaffold one prompt (chat / search / summarize, depending on your host use case)
> 5. *Separately, after this lands:* propose swapping the existing `streamText({…})` call to load the prompt
>
> I won't change your existing code until you've reviewed the new prompt. Proceed?

Always cite the docs page. If the user disagrees with the guidance, the disagreement is with the docs, not with you — and that's signal worth surfacing.

The user's "yes" is consent to **write new files only** — not to refactor existing code (Step 8).

## Step 4 — Provision the Cloud app (Cloud mode only)

If `agentmark.json` has `handler` set, or the user wants Cloud features, provision via the `agentmark` MCP server. See [headless-with-mcp.md](headless-with-mcp.md) for the `create_app` + `mint_api_key` sequence.

Write `AGENTMARK_API_KEY` and `AGENTMARK_APP_ID` to `.env` (create if absent; **never overwrite existing values without asking**). Confirm `.env` is in `.gitignore`.

## Step 5 — Write files per the docs guidance

Place files at the paths the docs page specified. Two SDK-contract rules override convention (and are themselves documented at SKILL.md and in the docs):

- Prompts root is always **named `agentmark/`** — the SDK loader resolves `<agentmarkPath>/agentmark/`. Setting `agentmarkPath: "/"` instead of `"."` is a known footgun.
- The client file is a **configured factory** — reads `AGENTMARK_API_KEY` / `AGENTMARK_APP_ID` from env, exports a configured client. Importers throughout the codebase use it.

If the docs guidance contradicts those two rules, prefer the docs (they may have evolved) but flag the discrepancy to the user.

## Step 6 — Scaffold the first prompt

One prompt only, named after the host's primary use case. Use the minimum viable shape from [creating-prompts.md](creating-prompts.md). After writing, regenerate types per the docs' instructions for the detected language (do not encode the command here).

## Step 7 — Smoke test

Boot the dev server and run the prompt. Exact commands and flags via `npx agentmark <cmd> --help` — **do not encode CLI surface in this workflow**. In Cloud mode, also verify a trace appears via the `agentmark` MCP server's trace tools within a few seconds. If either fails, debug before handing back to the user.

## Step 8 — Migrate existing LLM code (separate confirmation)

If Step 1 found existing `streamText` / `generateObject` / `client.messages.create` calls, **do not migrate them as part of setup**. Setup ends at Step 7. Migration is a separate confirmation:

> Setup is done. I noticed 3 places that call the AI SDK directly. Want me to migrate those to load AgentMark prompts? I'll preserve inputs/outputs and open it as a separate change so it's easy to review.

Migration is a refactor with its own risk profile. Conflating it with setup makes review harder and inflates blast radius.

## Common mistakes

- **Encoding integration content into this workflow.** Paths, packages, CLI flags, framework recommendations — all of those live in the docs. Drift between skill and docs is how agents end up recommending stale packages. Always defer to the docs MCP.
- **Skipping the docs-MCP query** because you "remember" how Next.js / FastAPI / Mastra setup works. Your memory is wrong; the docs are right.
- **Inventing a path or package when no docs page covers the framework.** Stop and tell the user. The escalation is to ask whether to use the closest covered pattern as a starting point — not to guess.
- **Recreating `agentmark.json` or MCP config files from this workflow** — that's the CLI's job. If those files are missing, send the user back to `npm create agentmark`.
- **Calling the `agentmark` (Cloud) MCP server for project detection** — that server is for AgentMark Cloud, not local file inspection. Use `Read` / `Glob` / `Grep`.
- **Migrating existing LLM code without a second confirmation.** Setup consent ≠ refactor consent.
